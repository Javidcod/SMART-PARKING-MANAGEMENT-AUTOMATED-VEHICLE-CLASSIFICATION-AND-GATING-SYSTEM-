# SMART-PARKING-MANAGEMENT-AUTOMATED-VEHICLE-CLASSIFICATION-AND-GATING-SYSTEM-
The Smart Parking Management System uses machine learning and image processing to classify vehicles and detect parking slot availability. With ESP32-CAM, Arduino, and OpenCV, it automates gate control using servo motors and displays real-time slot status, improving parking efficiency and reducing manual work.
